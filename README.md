Data Preprocessing:

First, we will preprocess the data. We devote a significant amount of time to this step as it is a crucial part of every analytical task.
We will start working on the ‘Absenteeism_data.csv’ file and take it to a usable state in a machine learning algorithm.
 

At this stage, we will preprocessed data to a team of data scientists and machine learning engineers. We will proceed as if they have developed a statistical model that will deliver predictions based on the data you are feeding it.
